We have a couple of very exciting and important announcements in this newsletter, so please take a quick minute to read through any of the bolded sections that interest you.

                     <h3><strong>Fall Internship Opportunities at Bettor Vision</strong></h3>
                     
                     <p>Bettor Vision reached out to us to recruit part-time fall interns! This is a flexible work opportunity, and you can receive pay through the Metcalf Grant. Below is the role and company description. If you’re interested in the role and/or company, you can reach out to their co-founder and COO, Geoff Doyle, through his email <a href="mailto:geoff@bettorvision.us">geoff@bettorvision.us</a>. We will also be looking to host him and others from Bettor Vision at the club in the future!</p>
                     
                     <h4><strong>Front-End Developer</strong></h4>
                     
                     <p>Bettor Vision is seeking an intern for the fall quarter who will focus on the development of our mobile app. The ideal candidate would have experience working on mobile apps, preferably using Flutter or a similar cross-platform framework. The intern will be fetching and displaying data from an existing backend. Experience with Swift and/or Kotlin is a plus, but the app is being built in Flutter.</p>
                     
                     <h4><strong>About Bettor Vision</strong></h4>
                     
                     <p>Bettor Vision is the only app where fans can sync all their sports betting, daily fantasy, and season-long fantasy accounts in one place. Our custom dashboard provides an easily digestible snapshot of all bets and matchups. We also offer more detailed views for price comparison, research, and analysis to ensure our users always get the best value. We have integrated 97% of the betting market, 8 season-long fantasy operators, and 4 DFS apps. Looking forward, we plan to leverage our unmatched visibility into the true consumer experience to build the first AI-fueled product recommendation engine across the betting and fantasy industries.</p>

                     <h3><strong>Chicago Fire FC Networking Event + Game in October</strong></h3>
                     
                     <p>We are organizing an event with other sports analytics clubs and MLS team Chicago Fire FC that will involve a speaker panel of Chicago Fire front office employees, networking, and watching Chicago Fire’s last home game of the season against Nashville FC on October 19th (Saturday night)! If you’re interested, please take 30 seconds to fill out this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/fATjADumrq3ct77s5">https://forms.gle/fATjADumrq3ct77s5</a>. Filling out the form is NOT a commitment. We just want a general sense of the numbers for planning purposes.</p>

                     <h3><strong>SmashUp Fantasy Football League</strong></h3>
                     
                     <p>Join our league through this link: <a href="https://app.smashupsports.com/i/Wv02wYbkNor1ErcR425UYQ">https://app.smashupsports.com/i/Wv02wYbkNor1ErcR425UYQ</a>. Like with our other fantasy leagues, the winner will receive a prize!</p>
                     
                     <p>SmashUp provides a new twist on fantasy football through SmashCards, which are power-up cards that you apply to players in your lineup to boost their scores in various ways. We hosted SmashUp’s CEO, Haibo Lu (Booth Alum), last year, and a couple of our board members (including myself) interned at SmashUp this past summer. We may post opportunities with them in the future as well. See the website for more info: <a href="https://smashupsports.com/">https://smashupsports.com/</a></p>
                     
                     <p>This is a salary cap based fantasy league (no draft), so you can join and build your team at any time. Just make sure to get your first lineup in before the season starts this coming Thursday. Also, keep in mind that lineups are set on a weekly basis, so your lineups should be made to optimize only for the coming week (you do not need to build your lineup with the rest of the season in mind, and there are no restrictions on the changes you make week to week).</p>
